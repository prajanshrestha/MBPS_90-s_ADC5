O- OCP (Open Closed Principle) 
Open Close Principle says that a class should be 
closed  for  modification  and  should  be  open  for 
Extension.  For  example  if  the  customer  class  has 
Gold customers, silver customers. In case in future if 
we want to add a new customer type then we have to 
modify  the customer  class and  we have  to test  the 
functionality  again.  Instead  we can  make  the  class 
should be closed for modification and should be open 
for extension. In other words rather than modifying the 
class we go for extension.
